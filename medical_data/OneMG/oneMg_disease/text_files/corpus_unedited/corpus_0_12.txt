Overview
Arthritis is a common condition that affects joints and bones (especially the knees, elbows, wrists, and ankle). The symptoms of arthritis usually appear gradually or sometimes may appear suddenly. The signs and symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, swelling of the joints, decrease in range of motion of joints, or redness of the skin around the joint. 

There are different causes depending on the type of arthritis. The most common types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Risk factors for arthritis include family history, old age, previous joint injury, obesity, smoking etc.

The main goal of treatment is to reduce pain, prevent any additional damage to the joints and improve joint mobility. Management includes the use of medications, surgery, weight management and exercises.

Causes Of Arthritis

There are different causes depending on the type of arthritis. The most common types are:

1. Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness and results in the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. 

2. Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. 

3. Gout
Gout is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in your joints. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. 

4. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16. This type of arthritis can cause serious complications, such as growth problems, joint damage and eye inflammation.

5. Ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of chronic arthritis that causes inflammation in certain parts of the spine.This causes pain and stiffness in the lower back and hips, especially in the morning and after periods of inactivity. 

6. Psoriatic arthritis
Psoriatic arthritis  is a chronic, autoimmune form of arthritis that causes joint inflammation and occurs with the skin condition psoriasis. Psoriasis causes red, scaly rashes and thick, pitted fingernails.
  7. Reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis is pain or swelling in a joint that is caused by an infection in your body. It causes extremely painful, swollen joints and the person feels very tired. 

8. Septic arthritis
Septic arthritis is also known as infectious arthritis, and is usually caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by a virus or fungus. This type of arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty in  the affected joint. The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever. 
Symptoms Of Arthritis

While it is difficult to know for sure if your joint pain is due to arthritis or not, based on the symptoms, there are certain signs that usually indicate you should consult a doctor. The four key signs include:
Pain: Pain from arthritis can be constant or it may come and go. It may occur when at rest or while moving. Pain may be in one part of the body or in many different parts.
Swelling: Some types of arthritis cause the skin over the affected joint to become red and swollen, feeling warm to the touch. Swelling that lasts for three days or longer or occurs more than three times a month should prompt a visit to the doctor.
Stiffness: This is a classic arthritis symptom, especially when waking up in the morning or after sitting at a desk or riding in a car for a long time. Morning stiffness that lasts longer than an hour is a good reason to suspect arthritis.
Difficulty in mobility: If you find it hard or painful to get up from your favorite chair, or after sitting in a single position for a long time, then it could be a warning sign of arthritis.
Risk Factors For Arthritis

Risk factors associated with Arthritis include:
Being overweight/obese exerts more stress on joints, particularly weight-bearing joints like the hips and knees
Trauma or injuries to joints
Habits of repetitive knee bending and squatting 
Smoking puts you at more risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis

Diagnosis Of Arthritis

The doctor diagnoses arthritis on the basis of:
Physical examination: Based on the symptoms, your doctor will do a thorough examination of the joints for pain and swelling of the affected areas.
Laboratory tests: Fluids commonly analyzed include blood, urine, and joint fluid.
Imaging tests: Imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans are commonly used to assess the extent of damage to joints.
Arthroscopy: This procedure involves inserting a small, flexible tube called an arthroscope through an incision near the joint. The arthroscope transmits images from inside the joint to a video screen.

Treatment Of Arthritis

1. Medications
NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are used to treat pain and inflammation and decrease joint damage.Some examples of drugs are: ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen.
Steroids are given to manage symptoms of arthritis, mainly pain and inflammation. These drugs also help in improving the range of motion by managing the symptoms.Steroids like prednisolone, betamethasone, and dexamethasone are used in inflammation. 
DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) are used to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation, especially in people suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Commonly used conventional DMARDs include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine. 
2. Surgery
Synovectomy, i.e., removal of the damaged joint lining, is also recommended in case of severe inflammation of the synovial fluid that causes arthritis. 
Joint replacement therapy is a surgical procedure in which parts of an arthritic or damaged joint are removed and replaced with a metal, plastic, or ceramic device called a prosthesis.
3. Physiotherapy

Physiotherapy is recommended to keep joints supple and flexible. Exercise can help in strengthening the muscles around the affected joint and prevent further damage. Options include stretching exercises, exercises that provide a range of motion, low-impact aerobic exercises such as walking, cycling.
Home Care For Arthritis

Using hot-water bags
Hot water bags or electric heating bags can be used to give temporary relief from joint pain and swelling on a daily basis.

Losing weight
Being overweight can increase complications of arthritis and contribute to arthritis pain. Make gradual and permanent lifestyle changes like eating healthy, portion control, avoiding deep-fried foods, and following an exercise regimen.

Exercising
It might sound contradictory to suggest exercise with arthritis pain when even getting up can be painful. Research has shown that exercise helps to warm up the fluid present in our joints and prevents it from thickening.

There are 3 types of exercises that are essential for healthy joints as well as for people with arthritis. These include flexibility exercises, aerobic exercises, and strengthening exercises. Each one plays a role in maintaining and improving your ability to move and function.

1. Flexibility exercises
These exercises are aimed at improving the range of motion. This means that they improve the ability to move your joints through the full motion that your joints were designed to achieve.
Flexibility exercises include gentle stretching and movements that take joints through their full span.
Doing these exercises regularly, ideally, every day, can help maintain and even improve the flexibility in your joints.
2. Aerobic exercises
These exercises strengthen your heart and make your lungs more efficient. They improve your stamina, reduce fatigue, and help in keeping your weight in check.
Brisk walking: This is one of the best bone-strengthening aerobic activities. While it is recommended to take a 30-minute brisk-walking session at least 5 days a week, you can start with three 10 minutes walking sessions anytime throughout the day.
Swimming: If you donâ€™t know how to swim yet, get enrolled in a local swimming club and befriend water as swimming strengthens the hips, knees, shoulders, and chest while having minimum impact on the joints. A 30-minute swimming session, 5 days a week is very beneficial.
Cycling: Cycling takes the hips and knees through their range of motion. It strengthens the thigh and calf muscles thereby providing support to essential joints of the hips and legs. A 30-minute ride 5 or more days every week is recommended.
3. Strength Training Exercises
Strengthening exercises help maintain and improve your muscle strength. Strong muscles can support and protect joints thereby preventing as well as improving arthritis.
1. Chair sit
Sit on a chair that does not revolve or have wheels fitted. 
Slowly rise up using the legs and the hip. 
Use the elbow rests for support if required. 
Stand up straight and again sit back down. 
Perform 20 reps anytime throughout the day.
This movement strengthens the hips, knees, and feet.
2. Leg raises
Lie down on your back and keep your hands on your sides, palms down. 
Slowly raise the right leg using the abdominal muscles while keeping both legs straight. 
Repeat on both sides 10 times each. 
This exercise strengthens the core muscles that support the spine.
3. Knee rolls
Lie down on your back, hands on the side and bend your legs at the knees so that the feet touch the ground. 
Inhale and slowly lower both knees towards the ground on the right side. 
Hold for 5 seconds and come back to the starting position. 
Repeat 20 times on both sides. 
This exercise relieves stiffness of the hips and the abdominal muscles.
  Massaging
Experts suggest that regular massage can help reduce pain caused due to arthritis. You can consult a massage therapist for learning massages that you can administer yourself or see a masseuse regularly. Massage with extra virgin olive oil is especially beneficial for relieving joint pain.

Other Daily tips
Here are some essential tips on how to care for your joints on a daily basis:

1. When using a chair
Avoid using your wrists or knuckles when getting up from your chair. Instead, use your forearms to push or get up from a chair. This helps in distributing the weight more evenly and prevents any undue stress on joints.
When getting out of the chair, one way is to lean forward with your hands around your knees and push up/stand up by using your leg muscles.
Another way of getting up from the chair is to distribute the weight between your forearms and the legs. This avoids straining the knuckles or the shoulders.

5. When holding a cup
Avoid holding the cup with just one hand. 
Use both hands to hold a lightweight cup or a mug.
