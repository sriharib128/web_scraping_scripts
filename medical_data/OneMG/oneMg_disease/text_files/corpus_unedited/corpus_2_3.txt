Chikungunya
Overview

Chikungunya is a viral disease that spreads to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitos. The most prevalent mosquitoes implicated are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These two species can also transmit other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue. They bite throughout the day, with peak activity in the early morning and late afternoon. 

Chikungunya is characterized by fever and severe joint pain, which is often debilitating and varies in duration; other symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. 

Prevention of Chikungunya involves protecting oneself from mosquito bites by using various tools like nets, sprays, coils, electric bats, and mosquito repellent creams. Mosquito control measures like eliminating stagnant water from plants, coolers, tyres, and road potholes is also crucial.

Abrupt onset of fever or chills
Severe joint pain and swelling
Joint stiffness
Knee pain 
Shoulder pain
Muscular pain
Headache
Nausea
Rashes and redness of the skin
Fatigue or tiredness

Causes Of Chikungunya 

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species.

When an uninfected mosquito bites a person infected with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the virus enters the mosquito's body. After a few days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands. 

When the mosquito bites another person, the CHIKV enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body, infecting various tissues, including muscle cells and immune cells. In the new person, the virus multiplies and reaches high levels in their blood, causing symptoms of chikungunya.

This virus can enter the body through the skin, when we breathe (respiration), through the mouth (ingestion), through sex (vaginal, oral, anal) or close sexual contact, or to an unborn baby through the placenta or birth canal.

The virus primarily targets cells in the joints, leading to inflammation and severe joint pain.
Risk Factors For Chikungunya 

While anyone can contract chikungunya, the following risk factors may increase the likelihood of infection or the severity of the disease:

Staying or traveling to regions where chikungunya is endemic or experiencing outbreaks.
Living in areas with inadequate mosquito control measures, such as stagnant water sources or poor sanitation.
Spending time outdoors, especially in areas with high mosquito populations. Mosquito exposure is more likely during the daytime, particularly around dawn and dusk when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.
Wetter and hotter months of the year.
Individuals who have not been previously infected with chikungunya.
Infants, young children, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions.

Ever wondered why mosquitoes prefer biting you over others?
There might be times when you might have wondered why mosquitoes bite you more than others. Well, this could be because of:
'O' Blood type 
Mosquito attracting genes
Pregnancy 
Consumption of alcohol

The rationale behind this is that alcohol consumption, pregnancy, and even physical activity raise your metabolic rate, causing you to exhale more carbon dioxide, which in turn attracts more mosquitoes.
Diagnosis Of Chikungunya 

The diagnosis of chikungunya involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests. Here are the key steps involved in diagnosing chikungunya:

1. Medical history and physical examination
The healthcare provider will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including information about recent travel to regions where chikungunya is prevalent and symptoms you may be experiencing. A physical examination to check for signs of the disease will also be performed.

2. Symptoms
Chikungunya is characterized by symptoms like sudden onset of high fever, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, rash, and fatigue. These symptoms can be similar to those of dengue and Zika, making it important to consider the possibility of chikungunya based on the presence of symptoms and the geographical location.

3. Laboratory Tests
The most commonly used tests for the diagnosis of chikungunya include

a. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR): This test detects the genetic material (RNA) of the chikungunya virus in a blood sample. It is most effective during the first week of illness when the virus is actively replicating.

b. Antibody tests: Also known as serological tests, are designed to identify the existence of antibodies in the bloodstream, which typically develop after an infection. These tests employ either indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods.

The purpose of these tests is to detect the presence of anti-chikungunya antibodies, specifically IgM (which is detectable from five days to several weeks after infection) and IgG (which remains present from two weeks to several years after infection).

It's important to note that antibody tests do not detect current infections but indicate previous exposure to the virus.

4. Other tests
In most situations, it is advisable to undergo a complete blood count (CBC). This can provide your doctor with information about the severity of the infection and the presence of other conditions like anemia caused by the infection.

Don’t ignore the symptoms and get tested.

How to differentiate between chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus disease?
Dengue, Zika virus disease, and chikungunya infection are all mosquito-borne viral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. These conditions share common symptoms like fever, rash, and joint pain, making symptom-based diagnosis challenging. However, specific laboratory tests, such as RT-PCR and serological tests, play a crucial role in differentiating between these infections and confirming the diagnosis.
Prevention Of Chikungunya 


Presently there is no approved vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya. 
Two vaccine candidates, one made from a modified measles virus and another using virus-like particles, have completed initial tests. More research and trials are underway before the vaccine is approved for public use.
In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to avoid chikungunya is by taking measures to protect yourself from mosquito bites.

Preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites

Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when working outdoors during the day to reduce the risk of mosquito bites.
Install window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of your living areas.
Avoid outdoor activities during times when mosquitoes are most active.
Use mosquito nets or screens around beds to create a barrier against mosquitoes.
Consider using mosquito zapping devices, such as electric bats, to control the mosquito population.
To minimize mosquito attraction, switch your outdoor lights to yellow "bug" lights. While not repellent, these lights tend to attract fewer mosquitoes compared to regular lights.
Apply mosquito repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, Para-menthane-diol (PMD), or oil of lemon eucalyptus.

Pro Tip: Apply sunscreen before applying mosquito repellent.

Tips for babies and children
Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) on children under the age of 3.
Avoid applying insect repellent on a child's hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin.
When using insect repellent for children, adults should first spray it onto their own hands and then apply it to the child's face.
After returning indoors, wash your children's skin with soap and water to remove any repellent, and wash their clothing before they wear it again.
Avoid using sprays in pressurized containers that children may accidentally inhale or get into their eyes.

Products for preventing mosquito bites

Mosquito repellent bands: Worn on the wrist, they come in chemical (DEET-impregnated) and natural (essential oils) varieties.

Mosquito patches: Stickers stuck on clothes (collars, sleeves, skirts, shorts) available in chemical and herbal forms.

Body lotion or mosquito sprays: Synthetic repellents (DEET, permethrin) or natural repellents (citronella) for protection.

Mosquito repellent sticks: Similar to incense sticks, loaded with repellents, used in open spaces like gardens, terraces, or balconies.

Mosquito nets: Conventional option with fine wire mesh (18 x 18 strands per inch) for beds or window screens.

Additional repellent products: Apart from these repellents, there are products like blankets, floor cleaners, electric zappers and table-top fumigation machines, which help keep mosquitoes away.

Tips to prevent mosquito breeding

Avoid excessive watering of potted plants and ensure that trays are emptied to prevent them from becoming breeding grounds.
Regularly change the water for indoor plants and decorative items that can collect water, such as bird baths, tabletop fountains, flower vases, and fish tanks.
Empty water from trays under air conditioners, refrigerators, and other containers like pet or bird feeding bowls.
Clean these containers at least once every 15 days to disrupt the mosquito breeding cycle, which typically lasts around 15-20 days.
When not in use, turn over empty pails and buckets, and cover containers with tight-fitting lids to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.
Use dustbins with properly fitting lids and dispose of trash daily, as uncovered trash cans attract mosquitoes.
Implement regular fogging with mosquito repellents or larvicides, and consider spraying pesticides like DDT in potential mosquito breeding areas.

Treatment Of Chikungunya 

The main treatment for Chikungunya fever focuses on relieving symptoms, such as drinking enough fluids, resting, and using paracetamol for pain and fever relief. The treatment can be broadly divided into two phases:

1. Acute phase
After a silent incubation period of 2 to 4 days, patients generally display the chikungunya symptoms that may persist 3–7 days during the acute phase of the disease. The following treatment protocols are usually followed during this phase:

Rest should be one of the main recommendations as physical activities tend to aggravate the joint pain, contributing to local wear and thus to prolonging the clinical condition. 
Certain local measures like the application of cold compresses or ice packs and pain relief gels to the affected joints can reduce swelling and pain.

The two most commonly used medications prescribed for mild to moderate pain are Paracetamol and Metamizole. NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin are usually avoided because of the risk of bleeding.

In the case of severe-intensity pain, Paracetamol or Metamizole might be combined with opioids like Tramadol.


2. Post acute phase
While most patients start showing signs of recovery after a week, in some cases chronic and incapacitating joint pain can persist. 

In the case of moderate to severe pain that is not responding satisfactorily to the medications in use, other drugs must be recommended. Among these options are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine or sulphasalazine.

Once the pain subsides, the pain relief medications are suspended; conversely, if the pain persists, corticosteroids like prednisolone might be prescribed at an anti-inflammatory dose. 

Note: Special considerations are made for pregnant women and children in terms of medication choices.
