Sunburn
Overview

Sunburn is a prevalent skin condition that arises when the skin is subjected to excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds. 

It mainly impacts the outer layer of the skin and is characterized by redness, pain, inflammation, and in severe cases, blistering and peeling. Sunburn serves as a clear indication of skin damage and escalates the risk of developing skin cancer.

Appropriate measures of sun protection, such as avoiding sun or seeking shade, particularly during peak sun hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), wearing protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats, and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), can significantly decrease the likelihood of getting sunburned.

Keep in mind that sunburn can occur even on overcast days, as UV radiation can permeate cloud cover and reflect off surfaces. Therefore, it is vital to remain vigilant and take precautions whenever you are exposed to the sun. Nurturing and protecting your skin today will guarantee a healthier and happier skin in the future.

Symptoms Of Sunburn 


The symptoms of sunburn usually start developing within a few hours after exposure and may vary in severity. The full impact of a sunburn may take up to 24 hours or more to become apparent.

Common symptoms of sunburn:

Skin color changes, ranging from pink to red and even purple
Redness
Warmth
Tenderness, 
Pain and/or itching
Swelling
Peeling and flaking
Blistering

Symptoms of severe sunburn:
Nausea
Fevers
Chills
Types of Sunburn

Here are some types of sunburn based on their severity:

1. Superficial (First-degree) sunburn
This is the mildest form of sunburn and affects only the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis).
It typically causes redness, pain, mild swelling and causes negligible tissue damage. The area that has been impacted may exhibit a sensation of warmth when touched. 
This type of burn does not necessitate medical intervention, and its consequences could potentially be reversed within a span of 1 to 2 days.

2. Partial-thickness (Second-degree) sunburn
This type of sunburn goes beyond the epidermis and affects the deeper layers of the skin (dermis).
 It is characterized by more intense symptoms such as blistering, severe redness, swelling, and pain.
This kind of burn requires medical treatment to heal the damaged area and may take longer to heal than first-degree burns.

3. Full- thickness (Third-degree) sunburn
Severe sunburns are often referred to as sun poisoning. 
They occur when the sunburn is extensive and affects the full thickness of the skin.
Symptoms can include intense pain, blistering, swelling, severe redness, headache, fever, chills, nausea, and dizziness. These types of burns are more vulnerable to infections.
Sun poisoning requires medical intervention.
Causes Of Sunburn
  Sunburn occurs when the skin is exposed to an excessive amount of UV rays (in the form of UV-A and UV-B rays) emitted by the sun, leading to a radiation burn. This exposure triggers the production of melanin in the outer layer of the skin, causing the skin to tan as a protective response against harmful UV radiation.

UV radiation is classified into three categories based on its wavelength, each having distinct effects on the skin:

1.  UV-A rays: These rays have the ability to break down collagen in the skin and damage the cells responsible for generating new skin cells. As a result, they contribute to roughness, dryness, blotchiness, wrinkles, and sagging. Additionally, high doses of UV-A radiation can lead to sunburn, harm the genes within skin cells, and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.

2. UV-B rays: This type of radiation is even more hazardous than UV-A. It causes tanning, burning, premature aging, and significant damage to the skin, thereby significantly increasing the likelihood of developing skin cancer.

3. UV-C rays: Fortunately, the Earth's atmosphere absorbs nearly all UV-C radiation, which is the most dangerous type, before it reaches the ground.
Risk Factors For Sunburn

The primary factors that contribute to the risk of sunburn include the duration of skin exposure to UV rays and the level of intensity.

Here are some other common risk factors:

Skin tone: Individuals with light skin are more prone to sunburn compared to those with deeper skin tones. Lighter skin has less melanin, which provides some natural protection against UV radiation. Having blue or green eyes and blond or red hair also increases susceptibility to sunburn.

Outdoor activities: Engaging in outdoor activities for prolonged periods especially between 10 am and 4 pm when the sun's rays are at their strongest, without sun protection increases the risk of sunburn. This includes activities like sunbathing or sitting in the sun, working outside, socializing, vacationing, transportation, hiking, swimming, sports etc

Environmental factors: Factors such as ozone depletion, high altitude, and clear skies with decreased cloud coverage can intensify UV radiation, thereby increasing the risk of sunburn.

Certain Medications: Medications such as some antibiotics, diuretics, acne medications, and exfoliating agents can heighten skin sensitivity to the sun, making individuals more prone to sunburn. It is essential to be aware of any potential side effects and consult a doctor for guidance.

Sunscreen effectiveness: If enough sunscreen is not applied regularly, it may not provide enough protection from UV radiation, increasing the risk of sunburn.

Diagnosis Of Sunburn

Minor cases of sunburn typically do not necessitate a visit to the doctor. Nevertheless, if the sunburn is severe and accompanied by other symptoms, it is crucial to promptly seek medical assistance.

Your doctor will assess the affected area and inquire about your symptoms, medications, exposure to UV rays, and past experiences with sunburn. In certain situations, they may advise you to consult a specialist in skin disorders or a dermatologist for comprehensive recovery.

Prevention Of Sunburn
  To prevent sunburn, you can take the following preventive measures:

1. Use sunscreens generously and regularly
Using the right sunscreen product is your first step in lowering the chances for sunburn.
The information regarding sunscreens with the use of various scientific terms can be overwhelming. The following points can help you decipher these terms as well as help you choose the right sunscreen.

A. Types of sunscreen 

There are broadly two types of sunscreens:

1. Chemical (organic) sunscreens: These sunscreens contain ingredients that absorb UV radiations and convert them to a very low level of heat.

UV-A filters
Benzophenones (UVB and UVA2 absorbers) - Oxybenzone, Sulisobenzone, Dioxybenzone
Avobenzone or Parsol 1789 (UVA1 absorber) 
Meradimate (UVA2 absorber)

 UV-B filters
PABA derivatives – Padimate O 
Cinnamates – Octinoxate, Cinoxate
Salicylates – Octisalate, Homosalate, Trolamine salicylate 
Octocrylene
Ensulizole

Newer generation broad spectrum (UVA + UVB) filters 

Ecamsule (Mexoryl SX)
Sila Triazole (Mexoryl XL)
Bemotrizinol (Tinosorb S)
Bisoctrizole (Tinosorb M)

2. Physical (inorganic) sunscreens: These sunscreens function by reflecting, scattering or absorbing UV radiation. Their opaque nature gives a “whitening effect” which is an inherent disadvantage. However, this demerit can be minimized by the use of microfine particles. Examples include:
Zinc oxide
Titanium oxide
Iron oxide
Calamine
Talc
Kaolin

B. Sun protection factor (SPF)
Sunscreens are assigned a sun protection factor (SPF), which is a number that rates how well they filter out UV-B rays. Higher numbers indicate more protection. A broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UV-A and UV-B rays should be used with a SPF 30 or more. 

C. Protection factor (PA+)
PA stands for the protection grade of UV-A. It measures the ability of sunscreen to block UVA rays.This is an important distinction because SPF (sun protection factor) measures only UVB protection while the PA rating only measures UVA protection.

This is what each PA rating means:
PA+ = Some UVA protection.
PA++ = Moderate UVA protection.
PA+++ = High UVA protection.
PA++++ = Extremely High UVA protection.


Different skin types need different sunscreens. How to find the right sunscreen that suits your skin type? 
Tips to choose wisely!


Tips to use sunscreen effectively

How much to use: An FTU o Fingertip Unit is used to measure the amount of cream thatcovers the end of the finger to the first crease of a finger. For the face and neck, use 2.5 FTU.To cover the other exposed parts of the body, you need an ounce of sunscreen, which issufficient to fill a shot glass.

When to apply: Always apply sunscreen around half an hour before going out because it takes at least 30 minutes for the chemicals in sunscreen to get absorbed and start working.

When to reapply: If you are going out, playing sports or exercising outdoors, it is advised to re-apply the sunscreen every 2 hours. The same rule applies when you go swimming.

How to store: Usually, it is recommended to store in a cool, dry place, away from sunlight. Also, do remember to close it properly after every use.

When to discard: Do not use sunscreen that has passed its expiry date or if there are any visible changes in the sunscreen such as a change in color, smell or consistency. It is advised to buy a new one every year.

2. Seek shade
Minimize your exposure to direct sunlight, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., as these are the hours when the sun's rays are most powerful. 

Follow the shadow rule as a guide: if your shadow is shorter than your height, it indicates that the sun's rays are at their strongest, and you should seek shelter in the shade under an umbrella, tree, or any available form of protection.


3. Wear protective clothing
The following measures should be kept in mind while wearing clothes for the best sun protection: 

Wear lightweight clothing
Use wide-brimmed hats
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants
Use clothes made from tight woven fabric
Use thoroughly dry clothes
Prefer darker-coloured clothes. They prevent more rays overall from reaching your skin. Within the same color, more saturated hues outperform paler ones.

To assess sun protection provided by clothing, the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) is used, similar to the SPF rating for sunscreens. UPF measures a fabric's ability to filter both UVA and UVB rays. For good sun protection, seek clothing with a UPF rating above 15.

INTERESTING HAT FACTS!

What level of sun protection do hats offer? It's worth noting that the level of protection provided by hats depends on the width of their brims.

A brim width exceeding 7.5 cm provides an SPF of 7 for the nose, 5 for the neck, 3 for the cheeks, and 2 for the chin.
A brim width ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 cm offers an SPF of 3 for the nose, 2 for the neck and cheeks, and 0 for the chin.
A brim width less than 2.5 cm provides an SPF of 1.5 for the nose, with minimal protection for the chin and neck.

4. Wear sunglasses
Sunglasses not only protect the eyes but also protect the soft skin around the eyes. They should be used while moving out under the sun. 

5. Be cautious of reflective surfaces
The presence of water, sand, snow, and similar reflective surfaces can amplify the impact of UV radiation. Such surfaces can reflect the harmful rays emitted by the sun, thus elevating the risk of sunburns.

6. Be mindful of the UV index
Check the UV index for your location before heading outside. The UV index provides information on the intensity of UV radiation and can help you plan outdoor activities accordingly. When the UV index is above 8, avoid stepping out. If the UV index is between 3 and 7, follow all sun protection steps before stepping out.

7. Avoid tanning beds and lamps
A tanning bed is a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to give people a tan. These beds produce stronger UV rays even than sunlight. 
Steer clear of tanning beds, which can increase skin cancer risk and accelerate wrinkling. If you desire a tan appearance, consider using a self-tanning product in conjunction with sunscreen.

8. Stay hydrated
Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially when spending time outdoors in the sun. Sunburn can dehydrate your body and increase the risk of heat-related illnesses.

9. Be mindful of certain medications
Certain medications such as specific types of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, antifungals, blood pressure medications, and chemotherapies, acne treatments, and some herbal remedies can increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight.
Check with your doctor or read the medication labels for any warnings about sun exposure.

Prevention of sunburn in children
The best way to prevent sunburn in children over 6 months of age is to follow these A, B, C’s of sun safety rules:

Avoid:  Avoid being in direct sunlight during the peak hours of the day when the sun is the strongest and can harm the skin the most.

Block: Ensure the safeguarding of the skin by using sunscreen that has a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or above. Apply it half an hour prior to stepping outside and consistently reapply it throughout the day. 

NOTE: Keep in mind that sunscreen should not be used on infants younger than 6 months.

Treatment Of Sunburn
  Although sunburn is often a temporary condition, it's important to take appropriate measures to alleviate the symptoms and promote healing. Here are some steps you can take to treat sunburn:

1. Cooling relief: To ease minor sunburn, cooling baths and the gentle application of cool wet cloths on the burned area are the first line of action.

Here are some tips for soothing sunburn:
Use cold, wet compressions on the affected area. Avoid direct ice application as it can harm the skin.
Take a cool bath or a very gentle shower.  Set the water to a cool temperature that's just below lukewarm (not extremely cold).
If blisters are forming, opt for a bath instead of a shower to prevent popping them.
Avoid using soap, bath oils, or detergents while bathing.
After bathing, let your skin air dry or pat it gently with a towel. Avoid rubbing.
Repeat the cool baths/showers as needed for relief.

2. Moisturize skin while it is damp: Use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer or aloe vera gel to soothe the sunburned skin. Avoid using heavy creams or oil-based products, as they can trap heat and irritate the skin further.

3. Topical applications for relief: Apply a suitable anti-inflammatory paste-like aloe vera or low-dose (0.5%-1%) hydrocortisone cream to soothe irritated and sunburned skin, reduce the burning sensation and swelling and speed up healing. 

Tips for application: 
You can use gels or lotions that contain aloe vera, or you can cut a chunk off the aloe vera plant itself. 
Using the pads of your fingers, gently apply aloe to the sunburned area. Do not "rub it in".
Leave it a bit gooey and moist on top of the burn, as this helps prevent drying out of skin and becoming more irritated.
Reapply as often as required. 

Note: Do not use hydrocortisone cream on young children. Ask your healthcare provider for advice if you have any doubts or concerns about using this cream.
  4. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium can help reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation associated with sunburn.

5. Blister management: If blisters develop, avoid popping them unless necessary. They act as a natural barrier against infection and help the skin heal. If a blister does break on its own, clean the area gently and apply an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection.

Here are some guidelines to follow when dealing with blisters:
Apply aloe vera or low-dose (0.5%-1%) hydrocortisone ointment on blisters.
Cover blisters with a loosely-wrapped gauze bandage.
Change the bandage daily or when it gets wet or dirty.
Wear loose cotton clothing over blisters.
Wash your hands with soap and water before touching blisters.

6. Replenish fluids: Sunburn can cause dehydration, so drink plenty of water. Aim for at least 8 glasses (8 ounces/236ml each) per day, or even more.

7. Protect sunburned skin: Protect the sunburned area from further sun exposure until it has fully healed. Further exposure to UV rays will only worsen the condition. If you need to go outside, wear loose-fitting clothing that covers the affected area, use a wide-brimmed hat, and apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF to other exposed areas.
Can sunscreen application reduce Vitamin D levels?
Sunlight plays a crucial role in generating Vitamin D in the skin, accounting for over 90% of its production. Some worry that using sunscreen could hinder Vitamin D production, but studies indicate that regular sunscreen use does not impede Vitamin D production in healthy individuals. However, individuals with photosensitivity disorders should consider screening for Vitamin D levels and may require supplementation. Explore our wide range of vitamin D supplements.

Complications Of Sunburn
  Sunburn can lead to several complications, especially if it is severe. Here are some of the potential complications of sunburn:

1. Sun stroke: Severe sunburn can cause a condition called sun poisoning or sunstroke. Symptoms may include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and dehydration. Sun poisoning requires medical attention.

2. Infections: When the skin is damaged due to sunburn, it becomes more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. Scratching the affected area or popping blisters can also introduce bacteria and increase the risk of infection.

3. Premature skin ageing: Repeated sunburns can cause long-term damage to the skin, including premature aging, wrinkles, dark spots, and a rough or leathery texture.
Even tanning without experiencing a sunburn can result in skin damage and premature aging.

4. Skin cancer: Sunburn damages the DNA in skin cells, which can increase the risk of skin cancer, including both melanoma and non-melanoma types. Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer and can be life-threatening if not detected and treated early.

5. Eye complications: Prolonged exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can lead to various eye problems such as 
Photokeratitis, commonly known as snow blindness, is a temporary condition characterized by the inflammation of the cornea due to intense exposure to UV rays. 
Cataracts, a condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, can also be caused or exacerbated by UV exposure.

The scorching sun can cause sunburns and its associated complications. Right sun protection is key!

Living With Sunburn

Living with sunburn can significantly impact one's quality of life in several ways, such as

Physical discomfort: Sunburns can make daily activities difficult due to pain, itching, and inflammation, affecting tasks like dressing, bathing, and sleeping.

Limited mobility: Severe sunburns limit mobility and hinder daily activities, exercise, and work.

Impact on appearance and emotional and psychological effects: Sunburns can negatively affect appearance, leading to self-consciousness, lower self-esteem, and reduced confidence, impacting social interactions and overall well-being.

Sleep disturbances: Sunburns can disturb sleep, leading to fatigue, irritability, and poor concentration.

Increased Sensitivity: Sunburned skin becomes more sensitive to touch, heat, and clothing, which can limit daily activities and social interactions.

To mitigate the impact on quality of life, it is crucial to practice proper sun protection measures, including using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, seeking shade, and avoiding excessive sun exposure. 

Additionally, managing pain and discomfort with appropriate over-the-counter remedies, staying hydrated, and applying soothing creams or aloe vera can help alleviate some of the symptoms. Seeking medical attention for severe sunburns or complications is also advisable.

Burns cause pain and anxiety, even during recovery.
Complementary therapies that may help alleviate such pain and anxiety include:

1. Massage Therapy: Massage therapy involves the manipulation of soft tissues in the body, such as muscles and skin, using various techniques. When applied to burn patients, it can help improve blood circulation, reduce muscle tension, and promote relaxation. This can lead to pain relief and a decrease in anxiety levels.

2. Hypnosis: Hypnosis is a state of focused attention and increased suggestibility that allows individuals to access their subconscious mind. In the context of burn pain, hypnosis can help manage pain perception by redirecting attention, promoting relaxation, and reducing anxiety and distress. It can also help individuals develop coping mechanisms and enhance their overall well-being.

3. Therapeutic Touch: It is a gentle touch therapy promoting relaxation and a sense of calm. This therapy aims to rebalance and harmonize the body's energy, which can help reduce pain and promote relaxation and healing. It may also enhance the overall sense of well-being and emotional stability in burn patients.

4. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS):  TENS is a non-invasive treatment that involves controlled, low-voltage electrical stimulation of the skin to relieve pain at specific points on the body. By stimulating these points, it can help release endorphins (natural pain-relieving chemicals), improve blood circulation, and modulate the nervous system. This can result in pain relief and a reduction in inflammation and swelling associated with burns.
