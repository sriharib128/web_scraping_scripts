Sleep apnea
Also known as OSA syndrome. Sleep apnoea syndrome, Obstructive apnoea, Sleep-disordered breathing, Obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome
Overview

Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep causing one to snore loudly or create choking noises while trying to breathe.

It is primarily caused by the relaxation of throat muscles, leading to a temporary blockage of the airway during sleep.

Sleep apnea can also affect the quality of your sleep, leading to excessive daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. The other symptoms include loud snoring, choking or gasping during sleep, and waking up with a headache, or dry mouth. 

It can affect people of all ages, including children, but it is more common in middle-aged and older individuals. Other risk factors include obesity, nasal congestion, and excessive tissue in the throat.

The main treatments for sleep apnea include using a machine called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), wearing oral appliances, and making lifestyle changes such as losing weight and avoiding alcohol and smoking.

Types of Sleep Apnea
  There are two types of sleep apnea, categorized on the basis of the cause of breathing disruptions. They include:

1. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
It is the most common type of sleep apnea that occurs when the airway is blocked during sleep, making it difficult to breathe. The blockage can be caused by the tongue, tonsils, uvula, excess throat tissue, or relaxed throat muscles.

2. Central sleep apnea (CSA)
It is a less prevalent type of sleep apnea that is linked to central nervous system function. It is caused by a breakdown in communication between the brain and the muscles that control breathing. 
Did you know?
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep Apnea. Studies have shown that the prevalence of central sleep apnea is low, however, the prevalence of CSA tends to increase with age and is higher in the elderly population above 65 years of age.

Causes Of Sleep Apnea
  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the upper airway becomes partially or entirely obstructed during sleep. This is because upper airway muscles (i.e. back of the throat) get relaxed and your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in.

This blockage restricts the flow of air, leading to breathing pauses that can last for seconds to minutes and you might snore, snort, choke, or gasp. These pauses cause a drop in blood oxygen levels, leading to brief awakenings to restore normal breathing. 
These breathing disruptions happen repeatedly during sleep and make it hard to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep.

Risk Factors For Sleep Apnea

There are several both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors that can contribute to the development of OSA. They include:

A. Non- modifiable risk factors
Excessive throat tissue: Generally people with obstructive sleep apnea may have excess throat tissue, which can restrict their airway during sleep. Obesity, large tonsils, or a thick neck can all contribute to an increase in soft tissue in the throat.
Structural abnormalities: Individuals with a deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, a small jaw, or a large tongue may be more prone to airway blockages during sleep.

Age: Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in middle-aged and older individuals (above 60 years).

Gender: Men are at a higher risk than women, especially in the earlier stages of adulthood. It affects around 13% of men and 6% of women. Nevertheless, the risk for women increases after menopause.

Family history: Having family members with the condition increases the likelihood of developing sleep apnea.

Certain medical conditions: Such as hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and hormonal disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), are associated with an increased risk of OSA.

Acromegaly: It is a condition in which the body produces an excessive amount of growth hormone (GH). People with acromegaly might experience OSA because they have macroglossia (enlarged tongue) and could develop central sleep apnea as a result of altered respiratory control.

B. Modifiable risk factors
Obesity: Excess body weight is a significant risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea. Fat deposits around the upper airway can cause it to narrow, making it more likely to collapse during sleep.

Muscle relaxant drugs (such as opioids): Long-term use of prescribed opioid-based pain medicines can cause problems with how your brain controls sleep increasing your risk of sleep apnea.

Changes in your hormone levels: People who have low levels of thyroid hormones or high levels of insulin or growth hormone have a higher risk of sleep apnea.

Smoking: Smoking can cause inflammation and fluid retention in the upper airway, leading to airway blockages and contributing to sleep apnea.

Check out our smoking cessation products to get rid of this deadly habit.

Diagnosis Of Sleep Apnea

The diagnosis of OSA typically involves the following steps:

1. Physical examination and medical history
 Physical examination may be conducted by your doctor to assess factors such as obesity, enlarged tonsils, or other anatomical abnormalities. 
Your doctor will also ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, sleep patterns, and any underlying medical conditions that may contribute to OSA.

2. Sleep study
A sleep study is essential to diagnose obstructive or central sleep apnea. Tests to detect sleep apnea are:

Polysomnogram: During this test, multiple sensors are hooked to your body to monitor various parameters including brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, heart rate, and oxygen levels, to evaluate sleep quality and breathing abnormalities.

Home sleep apnea test: This measures your heart rate, blood oxygen level, airflow, and breathing patterns to detect any abnormalities. The results are interpreted by your doctor.

Here are a few things that need to be considered before you do a home sleep test.

Once the diagnosis of OSA is confirmed, the healthcare professional will determine the severity of the condition based on the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. This is known as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).

Note: * Apnea: Apnea is when airflow stops for a period of 10 seconds or longer.
*Hypopnea: Period of shallow breathing that lasts for at least 10 seconds and causes a drop in the oxygen level in your blood.

3. Blood tests
It is done to check certain hormone levels to rule out any endocrine disorders. The tests include:

HbA1c: This blood test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months, and it is done for sleep apnea to assess the risk of diabetes and its impact on the condition.
Thyroid profile: It  is a blood test that assesses thyroid hormone levels, and it may be done for sleep apnea to identify any underlying thyroid dysfunction, which can contribute to sleep disturbances.
EPO levels: Erythropoietin levels are a blood test used for sleep apnea to assess oxygen levels and potential causes of chronic low oxygen, which can be associated with the condition. 

4. Pelvic ultrasound
It is done to examine the ovaries and detect cysts, and rule out PCOS.

Treatment Of Sleep Apnea
  The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) depends on the severity of the condition. Here are some common approaches to treating OSA:

1. Breathing devices
Positive airway pressure (PAP) uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. This device sends a constant stream of air into a sleeper’s airway to keep it from collapsing. 
It involves wearing a mask over the nose or nose and mouth while sleeping. The mask is connected to a CPAP machine that delivers a continuous flow of air, keeping the airway open.

There are other types of PAP devices, such as

Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) - This device provides higher pressure while breathing in and a lower pressure while breathing out. BiPAP is sometimes used for individuals who have difficulty tolerating CPAP.

Auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP)-  This device provides different pressure levels throughout the night. This device automatically adapts to your breathing patterns and sets a pressure that is most suitable.

Nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP)- In this treatment, valves are placed in the nostrils before sleep that uses a person’s natural breathing to create air pressure that keeps the airway open.

Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)-  It provides air pressure levels that constantly adapt to a sleeper’s needs. It is used in individuals with central sleep apnea who cannot tolerate CPAP.

2. Oral devices
Certain oral devices are custom fit that you typically wear in your mouth while you sleep such as:
Mandibular advancement devices: It helps keep the airway open by repositioning the jaw and tongue during sleep.
Tongue retaining devices: This device keeps the tongue forward to prevent it from blocking the upper airway.

3. Surgery
Surgery may be considered in cases where other treatments have failed or for individuals with specific anatomical abnormalities contributing to OSA. Surgical options include:

Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP): Removal of the uvula (a small piece of flesh hanging from the top inside of the mouth, right above the throat) or excess tissue from the throat.
Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA): Repositioning of the upper and lower jaws to enlarge the airway.
Adenotonsillectomy: Removal of tonsils and adenoids (soft areas located at the rear of the nose and throat).
Tracheostomy: It may be considered as a surgical option when other treatments have not been effective in managing severe, life-threatening sleep apnea. During this procedure, a surgical opening is created in the neck, and a metal or plastic tube is inserted to provide a new airway for breathing.

4. Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HNS)
This treatment consists of an implanted medical device and remote control. The device works by stimulating the hypoglossal nerve (the nerve that supplies the muscles of the tongue) or upper airway dilator muscle during apneas, which controls tongue movement to prevent airway obstruction. 
Home care For Sleep Apnea
  Some home remedies, that can help with sleep apnea include:

1. Chamomile: It can be beneficial as it contains compounds that aid in relaxing muscles and nerves, promoting sleepiness. 

How to use it? 
To prepare a chamomile tea, simply add two tablespoons of chamomile to hot water and steep for five minutes.

2. Lavender: It is renowned for its anxiety-reducing properties and individuals with sleep apnea, struggling to fall asleep, might find lavender essential oil beneficial.

How to use it?
Try diffusing lavender essential oil in the bedroom or use a few drops on a cloth placed near your pillow to enjoy its calming effects and potentially improve sleep quality.

3. Honey (Shahad): It alleviates sleep apnea, as its anti-inflammatory properties can potentially reduce airway blockages caused by swelling.

How to use it?
Soothe your throat with a teaspoon of honey before going to sleep. 

Other tips to follow
Get some steam in to open up your airways.
Maintain regular sleep hours
Exercise regularly
Eat a well-balanced diet and cut down on inflammatory food
Incorporate a high-fiber diet into your everyday routine
Change your sleeping position and try to sleep on your side.

Complications Of Sleep Apnea
  Sleep apnea can lead to various complications and health risks if left untreated. Some of them include: 

1. High blood pressure: Repeated episodes of interrupted breathing can cause blood pressure to rise, increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems.

2. Heart disease: Sleep apnea increases the risk of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms due to disruptive blood flow. It can also increase the risk of stroke due to the disruption of oxygen supply to the brain during apnea episodes.

3. Type 2 diabetes: Sleep apnea has been linked to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

4. Mental health changes: Sleep disturbances can impact daily functioning and can contribute to mood disorders like depression and anxiety. 

Here are some natural ways to combat depression.

Alternative Therapies For Sleep Apnea
  Complementary and alternative therapies can be used as adjuncts to traditional treatment approaches for snoring and sleep apnea. However, it's important to consult your physician before you start any of them. They include:

1. Positional therapy
It involves training a person to sleep in a different position. Sleeping on your back increases the likelihood of your tongue and soft tissues blocking the airway during sleep. 

2.  Orofacial therapy
As per studies, it has been found that exercises for your mouth and facial muscles, also called orofacial therapy, may help treat sleep apnea in children and adults. This therapy improves your tongue's posture and strengthens the muscles that regulate your lips, tongue, upper airway, and face.

3. Acupuncture
It involves the insertion of thin needles into certain areas of the body. It may help promote relaxation, reduce snoring, and one of the studies shows it potentially improves sleep quality in some individuals.

4. Yoga and breathing exercises
Certain yoga postures, along with deep breathing exercises (pranayama), can help strengthen the muscles involved in breathing and promote relaxation. These practices may have a positive impact on snoring and mild cases of sleep apnea.
